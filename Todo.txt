Refactored some of the code
(input to many functions is now a ray instead of pos / dir)
cleaned up variable names a bit


Added a material class to record objects material properties
intersecting a ray with an object now returns a CollisionResult instead of just the 't' parameter.  This has pros and cons.  The advantage is that it is often better to calculate all properties in one go (for example imagine tracing to hit a mesh, then trying a calculate the normal, this would be difficult / slow).  The disadvantage is that certian properties (such as uv) are calculated even if they are not needed.  One solution to this would be to have a quick intersect (just t) and a slower full calculation.

Created generic object containers.
These can be powerful, in the future I'll add bounds testing to them and also transforms, improving both performance and creating a scene graph structure.


todo:
[*] refraction
[*] uv / texture mapping (planar, sphericial)
[*] cubes



Feature list:
[*] Cylinder primative
[*] Refractive objects
[*] New materials system including bitmap textures.
[*] Normal mapping :)
[*] implment new camera class
[*] progressive render with 2 passses
[*] anti aliasing

Maybe do in the future?

Todo:

[ ] cornel box
[ ] camera moves with keys
[ ] multiple lights
[ ] fix up lighting materials

[ ] local transforms (scale, rotation, translation)

[ ] container bounds (just a sphere is fine, this will help optimize boxes for example)

[ ] global illumination model (ambient occlusion)
[ ] polygon meshes
[ ] textured object
[ ] normal maps

[ ] make a cornel box scene
[ ] tidy up code style
[ ] procedual mandelbrot texture

[ ] Blury reflection / refraction.

If time:
[ ] sub surface scattering :)
