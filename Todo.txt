Refactored some of the code
(input to many functions is now a ray instead of pos / dir)
cleaned up variable names a bit


Added a material class to record objects material properties
intersecting a ray with an object now returns a CollisionResult instead of just the 't' parameter.  This has pros and cons.  The advantage is that it is often better to calculate all properties in one go (for example imagine tracing to hit a mesh, then trying a calculate the normal, this would be difficult / slow).  The disadvantage is that certian properties (such as uv) are calculated even if they are not needed.  One solution to this would be to have a quick intersect (just t) and a slower full calculation.

Created generic object containers.
These can be powerful, in the future I'll add bounds testing to them and also transforms, improving both performance and creating a scene graph structure.


todo:
[*] refraction
[*] uv / texture mapping (planar, sphericial)
[*] cubes



Feature list:
[*] Cylinder primative
[*] Refractive objects
[*] New materials system including bitmap textures.
[*] Normal mapping :)
[*] implment new camera class
[*] progressive render with 2 passses
[*] anti aliasing
[*] mandelbrot procedual texture.
[*] cornell box scene 
[*] basic camera movement
[*] multiple lights
[*] transparient shadows
[*] blury reflections 
[*] camera defocus
[*] local transforms (scale, rotation, translation) (man this was hard!)
[*] bounding spheres for certian objects. (i.e. cubes, but works in general for any container)
[*] global illumination model 
[*] sample buffer
[*] ply mesh loader
[*] mesh rendering (with fast subdivision)
[*] F1-F7 control lighting model.
[*] Scene: dragon
[*] Scene: many dragons
[*] in render and exit mode disable keypresses...
[*] auto clustering of scene objects (not super fast, but helps a bit)

Todo:

[ ] get running on windows
[ ] profile on windows
[ ] multi thread
[ ] print should not reset render


Bugs:
[fixed] shadows look wrong          <- yes, fixed, was only checking up to 1 unit away...
[fixed] checkerboard on inf plane   <- fixed with scaling of texture
[fixed] lighting on inf plane.      <- specular light was totally wrong on everything!
[done] test multiple lights
[done] colored shadows not working
[fixed] uvs are wrong               <- was calculating them in the wrong coordinate space
[fixed] lighting is broken?         <- very complex to fix, in the end it was that I was using
                                       p*m instead of m*p so I was using the transpose of the matrix
                                       which is ~ the inverse if only rotations are involved 
                                       (which is what I was using it for before, so I didn't notice)



Scenes:
cornell
dragon mesh
something outside

Debug modes?
Depth?
Different channels?
